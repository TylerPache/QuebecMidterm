    <h1>Grading Page</h1>
    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p>Good Design Techniques – CRAP. Alt and title attributes for each image</p>
        <p>Each image has an alt and title attribute. The color scheme could be more appealing but it provides a contrast so the text and images are more visible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p> Organization of information – text and graphics make sense – logical – use the CSS float property for some images.</p>
        <p>Each image is in accordance with the text it is paired with and is floated properly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p> Content – interesting read, excellent grammar, perfect spelling. Please do not make the content of text on the inside pages short. Try to keep the first page (index) to one screen, no scroll bars.</p>
        <p>I tried to keep the content brief and have more pictures than text. I can't guarantee it to be an interesting read but all spelling and grammar is correct with the correct accent marks on the letters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p>Navigation – easy to get around, intuitive, well labeled </p>
        <p>My navigation bar is present on each page, as well as having the title of the tab and a header on the page itself displaying which page you are on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p>Use of HTML5 and CSS3 (both text and positioning) Valid HTML 5 and Valid CSS3 – Remember to use the validators demonstrated in class</p>
        <p>All pages and CSS validate</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p> You must have some JavaScript. The JavaScript must have a clear purpose and benefit your site.</p>
        <p>I have JavaScript controlling the functionality of the survey as well as displaying the slide show on the home page and mouseover/mouseout events on the activities and points of interest page</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box" style="margin-bottom: 5em">
        <p> That you modified your exercise 4 and included it in this project and made the form submit button work to send the forms contents to multiple email addresses. Modify exercise 4 from when you submitted it previously. Change the background color, logo, and the radio button content to relate to this project – the place you visited. Also when you update exercise 4 for this project make sure this form has working links to all the pages of this project!</p>
        <p>The updated survey includes the navigation bar on all of the other sites and is correctly linked. When the visitor submits their form it gets sent to the designated email.</p>
